Apps2Org Launcher is an Android application categorizer/launcher. It is a fork
of (apparently no longer being maintained) Apps2org
 

The main feature of Apps2Org Launcher is the ability to organize installed
application by multiple categories/tags/labels. Once that it is done,
it allows to browse thru the categories and launch applications. Unlike
other application launchers, Apps2Org Launcher replace standard
home screen/launcher application, but instead provides its "launching"
functionality via set of widgets/shortcuts which you can put in home
screen using an existing launcher.

- For "All Labels" widget/shortcut, show also "Other Apps" category.
This is last step required to truly use Apps2Org as full-featured
application launcher - after all, newly installed applications are not
yet categorized, so without this feature, it is additional chore to
access them.

- It's possible to star an application from widget, using Choose Labels
context menu. Furthermore, it's possible to star/unstar an app directly
from widget context menu. These feature make it very easy to maintain
your categories and favorites "on the go".
